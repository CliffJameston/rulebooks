## How to Help
### Add a New Rulebook
### Update an Existing Rulebook

There are two ways to edit an existing rulebook.

#### Do It Yourself

On any rulebook, click the **Edit** button.

This will open **GitHub**. GitHub is a site that developers use to host code. I opted to use GitHub to host all the rulebook data. [Read more about that here.](/about)

If you don’t have a GitHub account, you’ll be asked to create one. Don’t worry, it should only take a minute! Once you’re in, you’ll see a bunch of text. The text is in a format called **Markdown**. [Learn more about Markdown here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Wait a minute… what’s that bit at the top?

This is called **Front Matter**. Front Matter allows us to insert metadata about the current rulebook without affecting the presentation. Front Matter is written in a language called [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/). 

See [*Rulebook Metadata*](#rulebook-metadata) to earn more about **Required** and **Optional** metadata.

Edit the rulebook as you see fit. At any time, you can [view a live preview.](#test-your-rulebook)

##### Submit Your Changes
When you’re satisfied, submit your changes. Enter a title and a description (be descriptive!) and then hit “Propose file change.”

Then, create a **pull request**! Creating a pull request means that I’ll get a notification about your change, and if I agree with your changes, I’ll merge them into the live website!

#### Make a Request
### Rulebook Metadata
### Test Your Rulebook

To preview your rulebook, copy the whole thing (in markdown!) and head over to the handy [Rulebook Previewer](/custom-rules). Paste your rulebook into the little text box at the top, then hit “Enter.”
