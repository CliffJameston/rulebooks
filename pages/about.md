# About Rulebook.io

Rulebook.io is a passion project of mine.

## How does it work?

All of the rulebooks are hosted [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/camden/rulebooks). This means that we get built-in community editing, additions, comments, bug reports, and feature requests.

I need to add more to this section, but for now, if you have any questions you can tweet me at [@camdenbickel](https://twitter.com/camdenbickel)! :)
