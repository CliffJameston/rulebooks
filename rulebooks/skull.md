# Contents
* 6 packs of 4 cards each with identical backs, consisting of 3 Roses cards and 1 Skull card.
* 6 double-sided game mats.
* One rulebook.

# Goal of the Game
Win **2 bets.**

# Game Set-up
Each player takes a game mat which is placed in front of them, Skull-side up, and chooses a pack of 4 cards with the same back, which are held in that player's hand, keeping the card faces hidden from the other players.

A first player is chosen.

# Start of the Hand
Each player secretly **looks** at the hidden face of the cards kept in their hand, then **chooses a single one** to be placed face down on their mat.

# Placement of Cards
## Place a card or challenge someone?
Place a card or challenge someone?

The first player can play a second card face-down on top of the first one played.

The player to their left can do the same, **and so on.**

**Continue** in this way, clockwise, until a player either can **no longer play or no longer wants** to continue. When their turn comes to play a card, a player can decide not to play an extra card and can challenge someone instead.

# Challenge
## Pass or Bid More?
The player who issues the challenge **announces the number of cards** he or she intends to flip over from among all those placed on the play mats of all the players.

Going clockwise, each player must then:
* Either **raise** the stakes by increasing the previous bid.
* Or **pass** their turn and push their game mat to the middle of the table.

We continue until all the players have passed except one, the highest bidder, called the “challenger”.
